How to create a new react app using cra?

# Answer 1
To create a new React app using Create-React-App (CRA), you need to have Node.js and npm installed in your system. If you don't have Node.js, you can download it from the official Node.js website.

After ensuring that Node.js and npm are installed, follow these steps to create a new React app:

Open your terminal (or Command Prompt for Windows users)

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new project.

Run the following command:

sh
Copy code
npx create-react-app your-app-name
Replace "your-app-name" with the name you want for your app. The name should be all one word or hyphenated. This command will create a new directory with the name you specified, and it will set up a new React application there.

Once the command finishes executing, navigate to your new project directory by using this command:

sh
Copy code
cd your-app-name
Now, you can start your application by running the following command:

sh
Copy code
npm start
This will start your new React application on your local development server, and you can view it by opening a web browser and going to http://localhost:3000.

Remember, npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2 and higher. It's recommended to have the latest LTS version of Node.js installed on your system.

Also, note that Create-React-App sets up a fully functional, modern React application with a robust build pipeline. You don't have to worry about setting up Babel or webpack configurations; Create-React-App handles all that for you.
